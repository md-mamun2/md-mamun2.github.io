My research focuses on the causes, dynamics, and consequences of revolutions, with particular attention to how organizational capacity, popular grievance, and transnational processes shape revolutionary outcomes.

## Project 1: Opposition Capacity, Grievance, and Recurrent Revolutionary Challenges

Why do some countries experience repeated revolutionary episodes while others do not? This project examines the conditions under which revolutions recur, focusing on the interaction between **opposition capacity** and **popular grievance**. I argue that revolutions are more likely to recur when organizational structures survive or re-emerge after an initial revolutionary episode and when grievances generated by post-revolutionary governance remain unresolved. Using large-\(N\) cross-national data and event-history models, the project analyzes how opposition capacity and grievance jointly condition the risk of revolutionary recurrence. The findings suggest that neither organizational capacity nor grievance alone is sufficient to explain recurrent revolutions; instead, their interaction shapes the durability of revolutionary outcomes and the likelihood of renewed contention. 

## Project 2: Revolutionary Spillovers and Effects on Neighboring States

Do revolutions travel across borders? This project investigates the **transnational effects of revolutions**, focusing on how revolutionary events in one country influence political instability and contentious politics in neighboring states. The project examines multiple mechanisms of diffusion, including demonstration effects, cross-border mobilization, and strategic responses by regimes and opposition groups. Using spatial and temporal data on revolutionary events, I assess whether and when revolutions increase the risk of similar challenges in geographically proximate countries. The analysis contributes to debates on diffusion, regional instability, and the international dimensions of domestic political change.
